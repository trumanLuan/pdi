    Subfamily 1 consists of 31 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 6) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 2 consists of 13 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 2) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 3 consists of 9 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 1) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 4 consists of 8 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 1) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 5 consists of 14 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 2) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 6 consists of 6 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 1) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 7 consists of 16 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 3) are analyzed.
    Subfamily 8 consists of 6 rows; only columns with at most 20% gaps (<= 1) are analyzed.
